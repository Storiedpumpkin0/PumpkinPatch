<h1>Step 1 -  Research</h1>
<p>Before beginning it is necessary to become familiar with the tools involved.
</p>

<br>
<div>
<h3>&emsp;VirtualBox: </h3>
<p>&emsp;VirtualBox is a free open-source type 2 hypervisor supporting Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
This means that it builds virtual machines within a host operating system (as opposed to running on bare metal).
The tools being used in this project are capable of utilizing other hypervisors, but since VirtualBox is free and commonly documented it is the hypervisor that will be used in this project.</p>

<h3>&emsp;Packer:</h3>
<p>&emsp;Packer is an open source tool for creating
identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source
configuration (taken from packers website). Packer
works by using a .json file containing directions to build and package machine
images. Packer can be utilized to create machine images for a pxe server,
Docker files, vagrant boxes, and more.</p>
<p>&emsp;When Packer is running it will:
<pre>      - create a new virtual machine
      - provision the machine with a kickstart/preseed file
      - run scripts against the machine
      - bake the machine into a completed image/box/dockerfile
</pre>

<h3>&emsp;Vagrant:</h3>
<p>&emsp;Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine
environments in a single workflow (taken from Vagrants website).With vagrant
one can download pre-packaged boxes and run virtual machines in seconds, as
well as run custom boxes. Vagrant works by reading a Vagrantfile which contains
directions to retrieve, successfully open, provision, and manage virtual
machines.</p>

<h3>&emsp;Apache: </h3>
<p>&emsp;Apache is the most widely used web server software.
Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open
source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the
world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet
the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most
WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software. However,
WordPress can run on other web server software as well (taken from <a href=https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/apache/)>What is Apache</a>)</p>
