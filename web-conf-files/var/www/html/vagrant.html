<h1><b><u>Vagrant</u></b></h1>

<div>
<p> 
&emsp; Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow (taken from Vagrants website).

<br> &emsp;  With vagrant one can download pre-packaged boxes and run virtual machines in seconds, as well as run custom boxes. Vagrant works by reading a “Vagrantfile” which contains directions to retrieve, successfully open, provision, and manage virtual machines 
</p>
<br>
&emsp; Vagrant requires a file called a “Vagrantfile” in order to run. These files are very simple and only requiring a few things. 
<br>
&emsp;To generate an empty Vagrantfile:
<br>&emsp; - Open a shell
<br>&emsp; - Navigate to the folder you wish to work out of  
<br>&emsp; - enter the command:
<pre> 
&emsp;&emsp; vagrant init 
</pre>
<br> 
&emsp;(note: if you know the path/url to a specific box, you can provide it and vagrant will generate a vagrant file for that box)
<br>
<br>

<h2> Installing vagrant  </h2>
<p>
1.) Go to <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>Vagrants website</a> and select the version appropriate for your operating system
<br> 2.) A pop up will appear. Click “save file” and wait for the package to download.
<br> 3.) Continue through the installer until the installation has completed. </p>

<h2>&emsp; Configuring Vagrant </h2>

<p>
<br>
<br>
&emsp; A Vagrantfile has 3 main sections: variables (optional), configurations, and provisioning (optional)
</p>
<br>

<h4>&emsp; Variables (optional)</h4>
<p>
&emsp; A variable section is good practice because it allows for easy value changes for the Vagrantfile
<br>
<br>
&emsp; see below:

<h4>&emsp; Configurations </h4>
<p>
&emsp; This is the only necessary section of a Vagrantfile. In this section options can be provided to supply environmental variables, virtual machine resources, and ssh login information 
<br>
<br>
&emsp; see below:

<h4>&emsp;Provisioning (optional)</h4>
<p>
&emsp; This section includes options for provisioning the virtual machine with options with shell commands

<h2>&emsp; Using Vagrant </h2>
<p>
&emsp; To run vagrant, open a shell in the folder containing your Vagrantfile and enter the command: 
<br>
<pre>	vagrant up </pre>
</p>

<p>
&emsp; Vagrant will then: 
<br>&emsp; - Open the box
<br>&emsp; - name the vm 
<br>&emsp; - provision the vm with hardware specifications and environmental variables
<br>&emsp; - SSH into the virtual machine
<br>&emsp; - Provision the virtul machine with inline commands 
</p>

&emsp; There are many useful vagrant commands that can be ran after the vagrant box has been created. Some examples are: 
<br>&emsp; - Vagrant halt -- shutdown of the VM
<br>&emsp; - Vagrant provision -- forces the provisioning inside the Vagrantfile to run again (useful if it failed the first time) 
<br>&emsp; - Vagrant ssh -- ssh into the VM
<br>&emsp; - Vagrant destory -- completely removes the VM and all of its resources 
<br>&emsp; - Vagrant -h -- display a complete list of commands
